  <meta property="og:description" content="Recently Six months ago I submitted a poster to a small conference that has been moved onto a virtual platform because of the ongoing pandemic. Every participant had to create a 60-second long video presentation of their submission, with the only other instruction being ‘be creative’.
Making such a presentation in a somewhat polished way turned out to be a little more challenging than expected. I decided to use blender because it provides a powerful suite to be creative in almost any conceivable way. In my case, I wanted to move smoothly between parts of the poster, cue up the audio and play videos places where otherwise there would only be static figure panels. However, blender can also be a little difficult. For example, the way it handles lighting, or rendering textures in the distance is not made for this purpose and can make a presentation look blurry and washed out. Thats why I decided to write a post about the settings I found useful tricks to get sharp text and crisp colors similar to what you would expect when you make your poster in a graphics editor. I won’t be providing step-by-step instructions for things where people have made better instructional videos already. I will be linking those videos instead. Some blender experience is necessary, but there are many truly excellent videos out there that explain how blender works.">

			<p><del>Recently</del> Six months ago I submitted a poster to a small conference that has been moved onto a virtual platform because of the ongoing pandemic. Every participant had to create a 60-second long video presentation of their submission, with the only other instruction being &lsquo;be creative&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Making such a presentation in a somewhat polished way turned out to be a little more challenging than expected. I decided to use <a href="https://www.blender.org/">blender</a> because it provides a powerful suite to be creative in almost any conceivable way. In my case, I wanted to move smoothly between parts of the poster, cue up the audio and play videos places where otherwise there would only be static figure panels. However, blender can also be a little difficult. For example, the way it handles lighting, or rendering textures in the distance is not made for this purpose and can make a presentation look blurry and washed out. Thats why I decided to write a post about the settings I found useful tricks to get sharp text and crisp colors similar to what you would expect when you make your poster in a graphics editor. I won&rsquo;t be providing step-by-step instructions for things where people have made better instructional videos already. I will be linking those videos instead. Some blender experience is necessary, but there are many truly excellent videos out there that explain how blender works.</p>
<p>First off, here is the actual video:


    
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
      <iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" loading="eager" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n0CsPZhWSy0?autoplay=0&controls=1&end=0&loop=0&mute=0&start=0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" title="YouTube video"
      ></iframe>
    </div>
</p>
<h4 id="import-your-poster">Import your poster</h4>
<p>The easiest way to get your poster into blender is to use the import image as plane plugin. You first have to activate it under <em>Edit/Preferences</em> then go to <em>Add-ons</em> and search for <strong>Import Images as Planes</strong>. Now you can go to <em>File/Import/Images as Planes</em> and get your poster imporated as a plane object. Set up the camera up so that it faces your poster directly. Finally, put the light source behind the camera, switch it to an Area light (select the light source and go to <em>Properties/Object Data Properties/Light</em> and select Area) and point it directly at the poster. There are a view more details about the lighting in the next section.</p>
<p>When you render the scene now, you should see your poster. To see how changes in the settings affect your poster right away, set your viewport shading to rendered (button in the top right corner of the 3D viewport pane).</p>
<h4 id="true-colors-and-crisp-textures">True colors and crisp textures</h4>
<p>Lighting in blender can be frustratingly difficult if you just want to have your white poster background actually look white and the colors look like they should. However, there are few easy steps you can take to get true colors</p>
<p>With your poster plane selected change the following in the properties pane:</p>
<ul>
<li>in <em>Properties/Render Properties/Film</em> set <strong>Filter Size</strong> to 0.01.</li>
<li>in <em>Properties/Render Properties/Color Management</em> set <strong>View Transform</strong> to Standard.</li>
<li>in <em>Properties/Material Properties</em> set <strong>Specular</strong> to 0</li>
<li>in <em>Properties/Material Properties/Base Color</em> (there is a little white triangle to the left of the words Base Color, click it to expand options), select <strong>Closest</strong> in the top drop-down menu</li>
<li>adjust your light source: I changed the default light to &lsquo;Area&rsquo; light source and made it as big as the poster plane (select the light source and go to <em>Properties/Object Data Properties/Light</em> and select Area; you can also change the light source dimensions here). Put the light source behind the camera, pointing straight at the poster. You can change the light power if your poster looks too dark or too bright.</li>
</ul>
<p>To test your colors, render the scene, save it the file format of your choice and load it in a graphics editor (GIMP or Photoshop for example). Use whichever tool tells you the color code (in Adobe Photoshop its called Eyedropper) and make sure white is #FFFFFF.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aegiN7XeLow">This video</a> explains how to get a white scene background (which is not really what we are looking for) but it shows how to get to some of the settings I talk about above.</p>
<h4 id="smooth-camera-movement">Smooth camera movement</h4>
<p>Moving the camera around smoothly is perhaps one of the most helpful ways to make the presentation look polished. Pretty much everything you need to know about this is in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qyW1G350g">here</a>. Fair warning: it took me a little bit of planning and quite a few attempts until I was happy with my camera movements.</p>
<p>Once you do this, you will realize that your presentation is turning into an animation rather than a static scene. This means that rendering will start to take longer because you will now render each frame of an animation, rather than one single frame.</p>
<h4 id="recording-and-cueing-up-audio">Recording and cueing up audio</h4>
<p>Well synced audio is a great way to make your presentation feel more professional. I recorded clips of myself explaining one figure at a time. In blender I added the clips to the appropriate place in the animation. By doing it this way, I could perfectly time the entire presentation without sounding rushed. Blender makes it easy add audio clips into your animation and align them. In terms of recording, I simply used my IPhone 11 in a quiet environment.</p>
<p>Here is a brief <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gQ_1TbS7Ys">explanatory video</a>.</p>
<h4 id="embedding-videos">Embedding videos</h4>
<p>You can import videos with the same <strong>Import Images as Planes</strong> plugin. Simply move the video plane to the place in the poster where you want it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Similar to before, got to <em>Properties/Material Properties</em> and set <strong>Specular</strong> to 0.</li>
<li>When you expand your options for Base Color (<em>Properties/Material Properties/Base Color</em>), you can control at which frame in your animation the movie is meant to start playing. One frame in your animation corresponds to one frame in your video.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="video-output-format">Video output format</h4>
<p>Rendering your animation will take some time, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPbUuMs2i20">this video</a> does a great job explaining it. I&rsquo;ve rendered the video at 60 frames per second to make it look nice and smooth.</p>
<h4 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h4>
<p>The amount of effort required to make a video presentation in blender may well be more compared to quicker alternatives (e.g. recording your screen while you move through Powerpoint slides for example), but there two great benefits. First, you can achieve much better quality for both your video and sound. Second, you have almost limitless freedom to be creative and learn new techniques and tricks in blender.</p>
